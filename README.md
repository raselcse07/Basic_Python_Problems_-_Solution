# Basic_Python_Problems_and_Solution

There are some Python Basic problems.This problems are provied me by my trainer and I solved with Python3.

#Problems List

#Question 1:
Write a recursive function to reverse a list.

#Question 2:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.

The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8

Then, the output should be:
40320

#Question 3:

Implement a solution to the Tower of Hanoi using three stacks to keep track of the disks.

#Question 4:

With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8

Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

#Question 5:

Create an implementation of a queue that would have an average performance of O(1) for enqueue and dequeue operations.

#Question 6:

Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
34,67,55,33,12,98

Then, the output should be:
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

#Question 7:

Please write a binary search function which searches an item in a sorted list. The function should return the index of element to be searched in the list.

#Question 8:
With a given list [12,24,35,24,88,120,155,88,120,155], write a program to print this list after removing all duplicate values with original order reserved.

#Question 9:
Write a program to solve a classic ancient Chinese puzzle: 

We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have?

#Question 10:
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:

Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]

Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.

D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.

Example

Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180

The output of the program should be:
18,22,24

#Question 11:
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.

Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.

Example

Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
3,5

Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]] 

#Question 12:

Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world

Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world

#Question 13:
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world

#Question 14:
Using the find_successor method, write a non-recursive inorder traversal for a binary search tree.

#Question 15:
Please generate a random float where the value is between 5 and 95 using Python math module.
